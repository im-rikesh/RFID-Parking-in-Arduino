# Automated Parking System - using RFID and Database

This project uses arduino, RFID, RFID Card, a couple of servo motors, arduino ethernet module, IR sensors and a local database on a laptop. The laptop needs to be connected to the ethernet module via RJ45 cable. All the datas of the cars that are parked are stored on the database and as soon as the car gets out, all the imformation of the car are then deleted.

In this sample project, we have allotted the maximum number of parking space as 1.

I have uploaded unedited rough video for this project on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM048qrBsaA . #Don't forget to turn on the subtitle while watching the video !!!!!!!!!!!!!

The rough code for the project is uploaded in this. I am sorry for the inconvinience. I lost my final code. But if you have any queries, feel free to mail me at: r11kesh.n11roula@gmail.com or 071bex038@ioepc.edu.np .

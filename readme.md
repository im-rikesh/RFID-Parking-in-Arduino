# Automated Parking System - using RFID and Database

This project uses Arduino, an RFID reader, an RFID Card, a couple of servo motors, an Arduino ethernet module, a few IR sensors, and a local database on a laptop. The laptop needs to be connected to the ethernet module via RJ45 cable. All the data of the cars that are parked are stored on the database and as soon as the car gets out, the total time of parking and the parking fare are displayed and all the information of the car is then deleted. Imp! This is not a good practice. Instead of deleting the data, you can create an additional column in the table (say Active) and change the flag to "N" if the car gets out of the parking lot.

In this sample project, we have allotted the maximum number of parking spaces as 1.

I have uploaded an unedited rough video for this project on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM048qrBsaA. #Don't forget to turn on the subtitle while watching the video !!!!!!!!!!!!!

I lost my final code. The rough code for the project is uploaded in this repo. I am sorry for the inconvenience. But if you have any queries, feel free to mail me at: r11kesh.n11roula@gmail.com.
